# Mathematical Expression Solver

This project is a Python-based command-line tool for evaluating mathematical and logical expressions from a text file (`input.txt`) and writing the results to an output file (`output.txt`). The program handles various operators and error scenarios gracefully.

## ðŸ“‹ Features
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**` (exponentiation), and `//` (integer division).
- **Logical Operations:** Supports `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`.
- **Error Handling:** Detects and handles:
  - Syntax errors.
  - Division by zero.
  - Malformed expressions.
- **File I/O:** Reads expressions from `input.txt` and writes results to `output.txt`.
